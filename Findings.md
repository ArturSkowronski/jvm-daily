# Findings

## 2026-02-09 — Initial Setup

- Starting with plugin engine architecture for source ingestion
- DuckDB + plain JDBC as storage layer (Exposed doesn't support DuckDB — no built-in dialect)
- Koog Agents for AI workflow orchestration

## 2026-02-09 — DuckDB Timestamp Gotcha

- DuckDB's `TIMESTAMP` column type converts ISO 8601 strings (e.g. `2026-02-09T10:00:00Z`) into its own format (`2026-02-09 10:00:00`), stripping the `T` and `Z`
- `kotlinx.datetime.Instant.parse()` then fails on read because the format doesn't match ISO 8601
- **Fix:** Use `VARCHAR` column for `ingested_at` to preserve the ISO 8601 string as-is
- Alternative: use `java.sql.Timestamp` for proper JDBC timestamp handling, but VARCHAR is simpler for now

## 2026-02-09 — DuckDB JDBC

- Maven coordinate: `org.duckdb:duckdb_jdbc:1.1.3`
- In-memory: `jdbc:duckdb:` — great for tests
- Persistent: `jdbc:duckdb:path/to/file.duckdb`
- `INSERT OR REPLACE` works for upserts (SQLite-style syntax supported)

## 2026-02-09 — RSS Source Implementation

- **Rome** (`com.rometools:rome:2.1.0`) is the best RSS/Atom parser for JVM — handles both formats, extracts title, author, description, content, comments
- **kaml** (`com.charleskorn.kaml:kaml:0.67.0`) works well with kotlinx.serialization for YAML config parsing
- Rome's `XmlReader(URL)` constructor is deprecated — use `XmlReader(InputStream)` instead via `URL.openStream()`
- RSS entries without `<link>` or `<title>` are skipped (mapNotNull) — defensive parsing
- Test RSS feeds with local file:// URIs works perfectly for unit tests without network calls
